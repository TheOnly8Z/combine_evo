# Combine Evoloution
An addon for Garry's Mod that adds more tactically diverse Combine NPCs.

## Standard Units
These Combine units are similar in power to their vanilla counterparts.

### Riot Police
Metropolitan enforcers armed with riot shields to combat whatever makeshift melee weaponry unruly citizens have acquired.

#### Equipment

**Riot Shield**: See-through shield held with the left arm. Despite its frail appearance, it can withstand most conventional projectiles and melee attacks. Fortunately, it is far too bulky to humans to use it together with firearms, so Riot Metro-Police are armed with Stun Batons instead.

#### Tactics
Riot Metro-Police behave the same as their regular counterparts.

### Armored Soldier
Late generation Combine infantry, hastily equipped with armor in a desperate attempt to combat the post-uprising human resistance.

#### Equipment

**Standard Weaponry**: Armored soldiers use the same weapons as regular soldiers.

**External Bodyplates**: Synthetic armor worn on the chest, shoulders and thighs. When the armor is shot, it can withstand some damage and prevent flinching, but will eventually break. The chestpiece can only protect from the front.
The armor is especially resistant to buckshot rounds and melee attacks, but cannot defend against against explosives, headshots, crossbow bolts, and physics-based damage.

#### Tactics
Whether it is out of confidence from the armor or desperation, armored soldiers are more aggressive and tries to close distance as much as possible.
If their bodypack breaks, the shock will force them to flinch, and perhaps make them reconsider their aggressive manuvers.

### Eastern Dispatch Soldier
An unusual regiment of transhuman soldiers hailing from the far east (read: probably Japan or something). They favor coordinated assaults supported by their signature impact grenades and close-range SMGs.

#### Equipment

**MPN-45**: Sub-machine gun uniquely equipped by Eastern Dispatch soldiers.
- Compared to the MP7, the MPN-45 fires faster and in longer bursts, but is much less accurate.

**Contact Extractor**: Impact grenades that do less damage in a slightly smaller radius. They have a distinct look and are indicated by an orange glow and trail. Soldiers carry 4 and elites carry 8.

**Flak Jacket**: Shrapnel absorbing vest, reducing explosive damage taken significantly.

#### Tactics
When an Eastern Dispatch soldier throws a grenade, the squad will begin either a close range assault or suppressive fire. For five seconds, all members of the squad gain increased accuracy and can fire at the same time. This buff is indicated by an orange or red glow on their visors. Dispatch units will only attempt to suppressive fire on enemies without ranged weapons.

Eastern Dispatch soldiers are also more liberal with their grenade usage, and will not hesitate to throw them at point blank or when they are down to the last soldier.

### Eastern Dispatch Elite
Elite variant of the Eastern Dispatch units, deployed to command Eastern Dispatch soldiers or as individual squads. Their unique weapon makes them a menace both up close and at range, and their presence will make Eastern Dispatch squads more tactically aware.

#### Equipment
Eastern Elites have the same equipment as Eastern Dispatch units, plus the following:

**ZR-68**: Flexible automatic rifle with underbarrel shotgun attached. When enemies are close, elites will fire the underbarrel weapon unless it is empty.
- Compared to the AR2, the weapon is more accurate, but has slower bursts and a lower capacity.
- The underbarrel shotgun does the same damage as the SPAS-12 with bigger spread.

**External Bodyplates**: Eastern Elites wear external armor on their thighs and left shoulder.

**Blast Knuckle**: An impact grenade delivered in fist form. Initially a last-ditch attempt to kill a Zombine, Eastern Elites quickly discovered how survivable this suicidal maneuver is, and informally formalized it into their doctrine. However, survival is far from guaranteed.

#### Tactics
Eastern Elites are more discerning when it comes to assaults. When an elite is present in a squad, The squad will only attempt an assault if the squad has a health or numbers advantage; otherwise it will perform suppressive fire instead.

Eastern Elites will throw grenades at close enemies more frequently than soldiers.

## Specialists
These Combine units are much more threatening than standard units, akin to Hunters. They're best used sparingly and alongside larger amounts of standard units.

### Hemopathy Unit (Elite Metro-Police)
Veteran Metropolitan operatives wearing sleek black and red uniforms and a skull-shaped breathing mask.
Their intimidation factor is equally as important as their ruthless killing efficiency, often being deployed for VIP protection and for assassinating resistance HVTs.

Hemopathy Units tend to work alone or in small numbers, augmenting a Metro-Police assault with long range firepower.


#### Equipment

**Pulse Magnum**: Revolver adapted to fire pulse rounds.
- Compared to the pistol, Pulse Magnums deal significantly more damage and have much higher accuracy. However, they're still not pinpoint accurate, and will often miss at medium range.
- The weapon takes a long time to aim, indicated by a laser beam and windup sound. The target must be visible while aiming for the weapon to fire.
- After acquiring a target, the weapon can keep firing until empty, sometimes even if the target is behind cover.

**Stun Batons**: Hemopathy Units keep their enforcement tools handy in close quarters situations.

**Frag Grenades**: Hemopathy Units are equipped with grenades and will throw them much like Combine Soldiers would, just with a bit more eagerness.

**External Bodyplates**: Hemopathy Units have access to the same body armor as Armored Soldiers do. Their non-augmented body is still less durable than Combine Soldiers, however.

#### Tactics
Hemopathy Units act in a marksman role, preferring long range engagements with their revolver. If an enemy gets too close and personal and the gun isn't ready, they will try to pull out their Stun Batons to engage in melee combat.

### Combine Grenadier
Support unit using an heavy explosive launcher, specializing in medium range area denial.

#### Equipment

**Frag Launcher**: Man portable grenade launcher with high fire rate and long distance.
- Projectiles explode shortly after impact. While the radius and damage are small, the sheer volume of grenades makes grenadiers very intimidating.

**Relocator**: Special impact grenades that do no damage, instead launching everything in the affected area backwards.

#### Tactics
Grenadiers cannot use their weapons up close. They will make every attempt to keep distance, including throwing Relocators at their feet to launch themselves away.
