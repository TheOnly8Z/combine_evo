# Combine Evoloution
An addon for Garry's Mod that adds more tactically diverse Combine NPCs.

## Armored Soldier
Late generation Combine infantry equipped with armor. When shot in the chest, shoulders and thighs, these plates can withstand some amount of damage before breaking, increasing the soldier's durability in combat.
However, the armor is incapable of defending against explosives, headshots, crossbow bolts, and physics-based damage.

While more aggressive from the get-go, the armored soldiers' training does not differ significantly from typical Combine soldiers.
If the armor breaks, the shock will force them to flinch, and perhaps make them reconsider their aggressive manuvers.

## Eastern Dispatch
An unusual regiment of transhuman soldiers hailing from the far east (read: probably Japan or something). Using high fire rate SMGs and wearing flak jackets, they favor coordinated assaults supported by their signature impact grenades.

Eastern Dispatch soldiers' impact grenades do less damage in a slightly smaller radius, indicated by an orange glow and trail.
While identical in durability to regular Combine, they wear flak jackets that offer high resistance to blast damage, allowing them to be aggressive with their grenades.

When an Eastern Dispatch soldier throws a grenade, him and his nearby squadmates will gain an accuracy buff and rush towards the position, hoping to overwhelm the enemy.
If they are engaging enemies without ranged attacks, they will slowly back off while firing instead. While under this buff, the soldiers' visors will glow orange.

Eastern Dispatch soldiers are also more liberal with their grenade usage, and will not hesitate to throw them at point blank or when they are down to the last soldier.
