# Combine Evoloution
An addon for Garry's Mod that adds more tactically diverse Combine NPCs.

## Armored Soldier
Late generation Combine infantry, hastily equipped with armor in a desperate attempt to combat the post-uprising human resistance.

### Equipment

**Standard Weaponry**: Armored soldiers use the same weapons as regular soldiers.

**External Bodyplates**: Synthetic armor worn on the chest, shoulders and thighs. When the armor is shot, it can withstand some damage and prevent flinching, but will eventually break.
The armor is especially resistant to buckshot rounds and melee attacks, but cannot defend against against explosives, headshots, crossbow bolts, and physics-based damage.

### Tactics
Whether it is out of confidence from the armor or desperation, armored soldiers are more aggressive and tries to close distance as much as possible.
If their bodypack breaks, the shock will force them to flinch, and perhaps make them reconsider their aggressive manuvers.

## Eastern Dispatch
An unusual regiment of transhuman soldiers hailing from the far east (read: probably Japan or something). They favor coordinated assaults supported by their signature impact grenades and close-range SMGs.

### Equipment

**MPN-45**: Sub-machine gun uniquely equipped by Eastern Dispatch soldiers. Compared to the MP7, it does more damage and fires in longer bursts, but is much less accurate.

**Contact Extractor**: ED units employ impact grenades that do less damage in a slightly smaller radius. These grenades are indicated by an orange glow and trail.

**Flak Jacket**: Shrapnel absorbing vest reduces explosive damage significantly.

### Tactics
When an Eastern Dispatch soldier throws a grenade, him and his nearby squadmates will gain an accuracy buff and rush towards the position, hoping to overwhelm the enemy.
If they are engaging enemies without ranged attacks, they will slowly back off while firing instead. While under this buff, the soldiers' visors will glow orange.

Eastern Dispatch soldiers are also more liberal with their grenade usage, and will not hesitate to throw them at point blank or when they are down to the last soldier.
